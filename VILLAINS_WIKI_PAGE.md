== Game Structure & Round Progression ==

=== Understanding Rounds vs Days ===
Villains of the Night consists of multiple '''rounds''', not just days and nights:

* '''Round''' = One complete villain cycle (from selection to voting)
* '''Day/Night Cycle''' = Phases within each round
* Game continues through multiple rounds until <5 players remain

=== How Villain Selection Works ===
# '''Initial Setup:''' After character selection, one player is '''randomly''' chosen as villain
# '''Villain Notification:''' Only the villain knows they're the villain
# '''Between Rounds:''' When a villain leaves the game (caught or not), a new villain is randomly selected from remaining players
# '''Previous Villains:''' Once you've been villain, you leave the game after voting and cannot be villain again
# '''Special Case:''' Der Freischütz contracts can transfer villain status mid-game

=== Round Flow ===
Each round follows this pattern:

'''New Round Starts''' → '''Morning Phase''' → '''Evening Phase''' → '''Nighttime Phase''' → 
* '''If nobody dies:''' → Back to Morning (same round continues)
* '''If someone dies:''' → Investigation → Trial → Voting → '''Round Ends''' → '''New Round Starts'''

=== Key Points ===
* Multiple day/night cycles can happen in one round (if nobody dies)
* Villain remains the same throughout entire round
* New villain only selected when current villain leaves (voted out or wins)
* Your items and victory points carry between rounds
* Game ends when <5 players remain (all survivors win based on points)

== Victory Point System ==
Unlike traditional Mafia games, '''nobody dies from voting''' in Villains of the Night. Instead, players earn or lose victory points:

{| class="wikitable"
! Action !! Points !! Result
|-
| Vote for the actual villain || style="color:green" | '''+1''' || Villain leaves (caught)
|-
| Vote for an innocent player || style="color:red" | '''-1''' || Innocent stays, villain leaves anyway
|-
| Tie vote or no votes || style="color:red" | '''-1''' || Villain wins by default and leaves
|}

* The villain '''ALWAYS''' leaves after voting, whether caught or not
* Game continues with a new villain until fewer than 5 players remain
* '''Winners:''' Innocents with 1+ victory points, and all villains who were not caught.
* '''Losers:''' Innocents with 0 or negative points, and all villains who were caught.

== Game Phases ==
'''Note:''' These phases repeat within each round until someone dies or the villain is voted out.

=== Morning Phase (5-10 minutes) ===
* All doors unlocked - explore freely
* Items spawn around the facility (green outline = fresh)
* Talk and trade with other players
* Pick up to 3 "fresh" items
* Vote to extend morning by 5 minutes if needed

=== Evening Phase (1 minute) ===
* Everyone locked in their rooms
* Select night actions using "Select Night Actions" verb
* Choose one '''Main Action''':
** Talk/Trade - Visit someone for 2 minutes
** Use Character Ability - Your unique power
** Use Item - Activate a main action item
** Eliminate - Villain only
* Optionally choose one '''Secondary Action''':
** Use Item - Activate a secondary action item
** Character-specific secondary abilities

=== Nighttime Phase (0-8 minutes) ===
* Actions resolve automatically by priority
* 5-second delay between each action
* Someone might die!

=== If Someone Dies: ===

==== Investigation Phase (5 minutes) ====

==== Trial Briefing (2 minutes) ====
* Everyone teleported to main room

==== Discussion Phase (8-14 minutes) ====

==== Voting Phase (1 minute) ====
* Vote for who you think is the villain
* Wrong votes cost you points!

==== Results Phase (3.5 minutes) ====

=== After Voting - What Happens Next? ===
* '''Current villain leaves the game''' (whether caught or not)
* If 5+ players remain: '''New round starts'''
  * New villain randomly selected from remaining players
  * Everyone keeps their items and victory points
