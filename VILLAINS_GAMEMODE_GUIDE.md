# Villains of the Night - Complete Player Guide

## Quick Overview

**Villains of the Night** is a social deduction game (like Mafia or Among Us) where 6-12 players control abnormalities with unique abilities. One player secretly becomes the "villain" each round and tries to eliminate others, while everyone else works together to identify and vote out the villain. The twist? Nobody dies from voting - instead, players earn or lose **victory points** across multiple rounds!

## How to Win (Victory Point System)

Unlike traditional Mafia games, **nobody dies from voting**! Instead:

- **Correct Vote** ✅: If you vote out the actual villain, you gain **+1 victory point** (villain leaves the round)
- **Incorrect Vote** ❌: If you vote out an innocent player, you lose **-1 victory point** (innocent stays, villain leaves)
- **The villain ALWAYS leaves after each vote** - either caught (everyone wins points) or successful deception (everyone loses points)

The game continues with a new villain until fewer than 5 players remain. Then:
- **Players with 1+ victory points WIN! 🎉**
- **Players with 0 or negative points lose 😢**
